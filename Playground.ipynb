    "\n",
    "Using gemetry, I could show that six senders can be arranged around a receiver in the center with equal distance.\n",
    "If this equal distance is just above the detection theshold distance, e.g., 1125 m for the `Default` configuration, then all could send at the same time.\n",
    "Then none of the other stations (central receiver or the other senders) would be able to detect a signal.\n",
    "But at the central receiver, six interferer signals with roughly `detectionThreshold` (so -98 dBm in the `Default` config) would come in.\n",
    "This would mean that interference adds around **8.45 dBm** to Noise (multiplying it by 7, assuming `noiseFloor == minPowerLevel`, as is the case in `Default`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For an actual message to come in, there are two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is another sender at the center, very close to the receiver, and outside of the detection distance of the other (outer) interferer-senders.\n",
    "   This may require the outer senders to move outwards a little further.\n",
    "   (The resulting signal at the reciever will probably come through despite the interference, as it has a very high power level due to the low distance.)\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. One of the outer interferers is replaced with an actual sender, and that sender is moved in towards the receiver.\n",
    "   It needs to be at least within detection distance, but for any chance of successfully receiving the message, it has to be much closer.\n",
    "   For comparison, even without interference, the maximum reliable distance is around 500 m, compared to the 1121 m of the detection threshold.\n",
    "   With only 5 interferers remaining, the Interference adds around **7.78 dBm** to Noise (multiplying by 6).\n",
    "   So to be decodable, the useful signal would need to arrive with an RSS of -91 dBm + 7.78 dBm == 83.32 dBm.\n",
    "   This only happens until around 204 m of range."
